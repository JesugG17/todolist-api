# TYPESCRIPT STARTER KIT
This project is only a void project of typescript, thinking on a Express Application

# STEPS

# Install node modules
1.- Download the code and execute the command "npm i" for build node modules

# Compile typescript code
2.- You must execute the command "tsc" to generate the dist folder, on that folder you gonna
have the javascript files that you gonna execute to get ready the app (I recommend to use Nodemon)
